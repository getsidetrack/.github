## Hey, we're Sidetrack üëã

### üöä Who now?

Sidetrack is a project by indie developer [James Sherlock](https://twitter.com/JamesSherlouk) and aims to provide real-time public transportation information in the UK. 

We're focussing on the train network initially, but we'd love to see this grow. We want our products to be as inclusive as possible, with a focus on accessibility, privacy and transparency, while also ensuring that we're building a product that people can trust and rely on. We want to reduce the stress of getting from A to B.

### ‚ù§Ô∏è Where can I find out more?

We're actively working on building out the websites, applications, and supporting infrastructure for this project. You can follow along with regular updates on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/GetSidetrack), and we'll also be posting to [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/GetSidetrack), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbkVYabbpojzHwX4DTjFeig), [Instaram](https://www.instagram.com/getsidetrack/), and [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/GetSidetrack/) as our release approaches!

Following us on social media is a huge way to help us, and we'll be reaching out to get feedback and testers at various times. You can also help support Sidetrack financially by [sponsoring us here on GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/getsidetrack).

### üßë‚Äçüíª What technology are you using?

We utilise TypeScript, Swift (Vapor for the server-side) and Kotlin throughout our estate to support our two mobile applications, websites, APIs and more. We use OpenTelemetry for monitoring the stability and performance of our products.

### üåç Giving Back

We simply wouldn't exist without the great tools, libraries and languages created by companies and individuals around the world. We love to contribute to the projects we rely on such as [Vapor](https://vapor.codes/), [SnapshotTesting](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-snapshot-testing/) and [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/).

We do so while also releasing and maintaining our own open source projects, including new GitHub actions, and more Swift packages compatible with Vapor. This is an area that will only grow as we do, any opportunity to share code will be taken!
